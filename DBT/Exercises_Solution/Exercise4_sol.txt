SQL Exercise 4
1. Display the minimum Status in the Supplier table.
SELECT MIN(Status) AS MinimumStatus FROM S;


2. Display the maximum Weight in the Parts table.
SELECT MAX(Weight) AS MaximumWeight FROM P;


3. Display the average Weight of the Parts.
SELECT AVG(Weight) AS AverageWeight FROM P;

4. Display the total Quantity sold for part ‘P1’.
SELECT SUM(Qty) AS TotalQuantitySold FROM SPJ WHERE P# = 'P1';


5. Display the total Quantity sold for each part.
SELECT P#, SUM(Qty) AS TotalQuantitySold 
FROM SPJ 
GROUP BY P#;


6. Display the average Quantity sold for each part.
SELECT P#, AVG(Qty) AS AverageQuantitySold 
FROM SPJ 
GROUP BY P#;


7. Display the maximum Quantity sold for each part, provided the maximum Quantity
is greater than 800.
SELECT P#, MAX(Qty) AS MaximumQuantitySold 
FROM SPJ 
GROUP BY P# 
HAVING MAX(Qty) > 800;


8. Display the Status and the count of Suppliers with that Status.
SELECT Status, COUNT(*) AS SupplierCount 
FROM S 
GROUP BY Status;


9. Display the count of Projects going on in different cities.
SELECT City, COUNT(*) AS ProjectCount 
FROM J 
GROUP BY City;


10. What is the difference between COUNT(Status) and COUNT(*) ?
COUNT(Status) counts only the non-NULL values in the Status column. If there are any rows where Status is NULL, they will not be included in the count.
COUNT(*) counts all rows in the table, regardless of whether any column contains NULL values. It returns the total number of rows in the table.


11. Display the Status and the Count of Suppliers with that Status in the following format
as shown below:-

Status Count
Ten 1
Twenty 2
Thirty 3 

SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN Status = 10 THEN 'Ten'
        WHEN Status = 20 THEN 'Twenty'
        WHEN Status = 30 THEN 'Thirty'
    END AS Status, 
    COUNT(*) AS Count
FROM S
GROUP BY Status
ORDER BY Status;
