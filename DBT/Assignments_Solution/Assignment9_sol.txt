Querying Multiple Tables at Once.

1) Write a query that lists each order number followed by the name of the customer
who made the order.
SELECT O.Onum, C.Cname
FROM ORDERS O
JOIN CUSTOMERS C ON O.Cnum = C.Cnum;


2) Write a query that gives the names of both the salesperson and the customer for
each order along with the order number.
SELECT O.Onum, C.Cname, S.Sname
FROM ORDERS O
JOIN CUSTOMERS C ON O.Cnum = C.Cnum
JOIN SALESPEOPLE S ON O.Snum = S.Snum;


3) Write a query that produces all customers serviced by salespeople with a
commission above 12%. Output the customer’s name, the salesperson’s name,
and the salesperson’s rate of commission.
SELECT C.Cname, S.Sname, S.Comm
FROM CUSTOMERS C
JOIN SALESPEOPLE S ON C.Snum = S.Snum
WHERE S.Comm > 0.12;


4) Write a query that calculates the amount of the salesperson’s commission on each
order by a customer with a rating above 100.
SELECT O.Onum, O.Amt * S.Comm AS Commission
FROM ORDERS O
JOIN CUSTOMERS C ON O.Cnum = C.Cnum
JOIN SALESPEOPLE S ON O.Snum = S.Snum
WHERE C.Rating > 100;
