Using Subqueries with DML Commands.

1) Assume there is a table called Multicust, with all of the same column definitions
as Salespeople. Write a command that inserts all salespeople with more than one
customer into this table.

INSERT INTO Multicust (Snum, Sname, City, Comm)
SELECT S.Snum, S.Sname, S.City, S.Comm
FROM SALESPEOPLE S
WHERE S.Snum IN (
    SELECT Snum
    FROM CUSTOMERS
    GROUP BY Snum
    HAVING COUNT(Cnum) > 1
);



2) Write a command that deletes all customers with no current orders.

DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE Cnum NOT IN (
    SELECT Cnum
    FROM ORDERS
);



3) Write a command that increases by twenty percent the commissions of all
salespeople with total orders above Rs. 3,000.

UPDATE SALESPEOPLE
SET Comm = Comm * 1.20
WHERE Snum IN (
    SELECT Snum
    FROM ORDERS
    GROUP BY Snum
    HAVING SUM(Amt) > 3000
);
