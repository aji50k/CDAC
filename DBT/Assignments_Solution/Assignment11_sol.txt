Subqueries.

1) Write a query that uses a subquery to obtain all orders for the customer named
Cisneros. Assume you do not know his customer number (cnum).
SELECT *
FROM ORDERS
WHERE Cnum = (SELECT Cnum
              FROM CUSTOMERS
              WHERE Cname = 'Cisneros');



2) Write a query that produces the names and ratings of all customers who have
above-average orders.
SELECT C.Cname, C.Rating
FROM CUSTOMERS C
JOIN ORDERS O ON C.Cnum = O.Cnum
GROUP BY C.Cname, C.Rating
HAVING AVG(O.Amt) > (SELECT AVG(Amt) FROM ORDERS);



3) Write a query that selects the total amount in orders for each salesperson for
whom this total is greater than the amount of the largest order in the table.
SELECT S.Snum, S.Sname, SUM(O.Amt) AS TotalSales
FROM SALESPEOPLE S
JOIN ORDERS O ON S.Snum = O.Snum
GROUP BY S.Snum, S.Sname
HAVING SUM(O.Amt) > (SELECT MAX(Amt) FROM ORDERS);
