Formatting Query output.

1) Assume each salesperson has a 12% commission. Write a query on the orders
table that will produce the order number, the salesperson number, and the amount
of the salesperson’s commission for that order.
SELECT Onum, Snum, Amt * 0.12 AS Commission
FROM ORDERS;


2) Write a query on the Customers table that will find the highest rating in each city.
Put the output in this form:
For the city (city), the highest rating is : (rating).
SELECT 
    CONCAT('For the city ', City, ', the highest rating is: ', MAX(Rating)) AS Output
FROM CUSTOMERS
GROUP BY City;

 
3) Write a query that lists customers in descending order of rating. Output the rating
field first, followed by the customer’s name and number.
SELECT Rating, Cname, Cnum
FROM CUSTOMERS
ORDER BY Rating DESC;


4) Write a query that totals the orders for each day and places the results in
descending order.
SELECT Odate, SUM(Amt) AS TotalOrders
FROM ORDERS
GROUP BY Odate
ORDER BY TotalOrders DESC;
