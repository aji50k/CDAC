4. Why isn’t it possible to see the first five rows of a table?
This could refer to the fact that, in some databases, data isn’t inherently ordered unless specified by an ORDER BY clause. 
Therefore, without explicitly querying the data in an ordered fashion, the "first five rows" may not have a meaningful or predictable order. 
Additionally, limitations of the query environment or user privileges could also prevent viewing certain rows.
