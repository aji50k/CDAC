Using the UNION clause.


1) Create a union of two queries that shows the names, cities, and ratings of all
customers. Those with rating of 200 or greater will also have the words “High
Rating”, while the others will have the words “Low Rating”.
SELECT Cname, City, Rating, 'High Rating' AS RatingCategory
FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE Rating >= 200

UNION

SELECT Cname, City, Rating, 'Low Rating' AS RatingCategory
FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE Rating < 200;



2) Write a command that produces the name and number of each salesperson and
each customer with more than one current order. Put the results in alphabetical
order.
SELECT S.Sname AS Name, S.Snum AS Number
FROM SALESPEOPLE S
JOIN ORDERS O ON S.Snum = O.Snum
GROUP BY S.Sname, S.Snum
HAVING COUNT(O.Onum) > 1

UNION

SELECT C.Cname AS Name, C.Cnum AS Number
FROM CUSTOMERS C
JOIN ORDERS O ON C.Cnum = O.Cnum
GROUP BY C.Cname, C.Cnum
HAVING COUNT(O.Onum) > 1

ORDER BY Name;



3) Form a union of three queries. Have the first select the snums of all salespeople in
San Jose; the second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose; and the third the
onums of all orders on October 3. Retain duplicates between the last two queries
but eliminate any redundancies between either of them and the first.
(Note: in the sample tables as given, there would be no such redundancy. This is
besides the point.)
SELECT S.Snum
FROM SALESPEOPLE S
WHERE S.City = 'San Jose'

UNION

SELECT C.Cnum
FROM CUSTOMERS C
WHERE C.City = 'San Jose'

UNION ALL

SELECT O.Onum
FROM ORDERS O
WHERE O.Odate = '1990-10-03';
