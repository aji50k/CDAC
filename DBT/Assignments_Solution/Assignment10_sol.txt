Joining a Table to Itself.

1) Write a query that produces all pairs of salespeople who are living in the same
city. Exclude combinations of salespeople with themselves as well as duplicate
rows with the order reversed.

SELECT S1.Sname AS Salesperson1, S2.Sname AS Salesperson2, S1.City
FROM SALESPEOPLE S1
JOIN SALESPEOPLE S2 ON S1.City = S2.City
WHERE S1.Snum < S2.Snum;  -- Excludes duplicates and self-pairing by using Snum comparison


2) Write a query that produces the names and cities of all customers with the same
rating as Hoffman.

SELECT C2.Cname, C2.City
FROM CUSTOMERS C1
JOIN CUSTOMERS C2 ON C1.Rating = C2.Rating
WHERE C1.Cname = 'Hoffman' AND C2.Cname != 'Hoffman';  -- Exclude Hoffman from the result
