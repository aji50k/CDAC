      Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is
      designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is
      intended to let application developers write once, and run anywhere
      (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that
      support Java without the need for recompilation. Java was first released
      in 1995 and is widely used for developing applications for desktop, web,
      and mobile devices. Java is known for its simplicity, robustness, and
      security features, making it a popular choice for enterprise-level
      applications. Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc
      in May 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It is a simple
      programming language. Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging
      programming easy. It helps to create reusable code and modular programs.
      Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language and is
      designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. A
      general-purpose programming language made for developers to write once run
      anywhere that is compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support
      Java. Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any Java
      Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is similar to C/C++.
